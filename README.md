# fils_de_fer

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french,hence
the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points(x, y, z)
via segments. 

The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to the program.

For example:

$>cat 42.fdf

Each number corresponds to a point in space:

•	the horizontal position corresponds to its axis;

•	the vertical position corresponds to its ordinate;

•	the value corresponds to its altitude.


To execute this program you should type in the command line the following:
